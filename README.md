### Description

This is an update to the Versatile Mask Control and Ultimate Making Control. I have added functionality for Numbers and Number Precision as well as cleaned up the code for setting up the code at design time to make changes during run-time. I have also enhanced a couple of items withing the code to allow for better control of data being entered. I hope you enjoy this Completely revamped control.
